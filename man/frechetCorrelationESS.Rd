\title{Calculates ESS using a Frechet-like generalization of a univariate ESS based on the autocorrelation of the chain at varying timesteps.}
\usage{
frechetCorrelationESS(dmat, min.nsamples = 5, lower.bound = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dmat}{Sample-to-sample distance matrix for the MCMC chain.}

\item{min.nsamples}{We only compute the correlation between x_t and x_{t+T} if there are at least this many samples.}

\item{lower.bound}{Should we use the lower-bound ESS or attempt to estimated E(x_t) - E(x_{t+T})^2? Lower bound is faster.}

\item{trees}{For compatibility with eval and call, not used here.}

\item{nsim}{For compatibility with eval and call, not used here.}

\item{alpha}{For compatibility with eval and call, not used here.}
