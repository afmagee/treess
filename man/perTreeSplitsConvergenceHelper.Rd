\usage{
perTreeSplitsConvergenceHelper(
  mean.list,
  weights = 1,
  return.ssq = FALSE,
  return.sdsf = FALSE,
  return.gcomp = FALSE,
  return.mat = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mean.list}{list of output of \link{splitFrechetMean} or \link{splitProbs}.}
}
\value{
List with grand mean ($mean), and optionally sum of squared deviations to the grand mean ($ssq), 
the standard deviations of all split frequencies ($sdsf), partial components for a G test of split
probabilities (but without the factor of n, $g.comp), and the aligned matrix of probabilities in all chains ($mat).
}
\description{
Computes the grand mean from a collection of split Frechet means.
Can also return the sum of squared deviations to that grand mean and standard deviations of split frequencies.
Assumes equal weighting!
